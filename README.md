# Infra Knowledge

A collection of learning guides for cloud infrastructure concepts, written from first principles.

## What's Inside

### IAM (Identity and Access Management)

A comprehensive 7-part guide covering cloud IAM fundamentals:

| Chapter | Topic |
|---------|-------|
| 01 | Why IAM - The problem it solves |
| 02 | Core Model - Principal, Action, Resource, Condition |
| 03 | Identity & Credentials - Users, roles, and temporary credentials |
| 04 | Assume Role - Cross-account access and identity switching |
| 05 | Federated Identity - SAML, OIDC, and external IdP integration |
| 06 | Workload Identity - How applications authenticate to cloud services |
| 07 | Best Practices - Least privilege, zero trust, separation of duties |

Start with [iam/iam-learning-roadmap.md](iam/iam-learning-roadmap.md) for an overview.

### Kubernetes

A guide to understanding Kubernetes from the ground up:

| Chapter | Topic |
|---------|-------|
| 01 | Why Kubernetes - What problems it solves beyond Docker |
| 02 | Architecture - Control plane, worker nodes, and the reconciliation loop |

Start with [k8s/k8s-learning-roadmap.md](k8s/k8s-learning-roadmap.md) for an overview.

## Approach

These guides follow a **first principles** teaching method:

1. **Why** - Understand the problem before the solution
2. **What** - Learn the core model and abstractions
3. **How** - See practical implementations and patterns

Visual explanations use ASCII diagrams. Concepts are organized in progressive layers, building from fundamentals to advanced topics.
